                    Note: A patrol zone is a completely seperate entity from a member zone.  A patrol zone may comprise 
                    one or more member zones.
                </p>
                If your organisation runs member patrols, then before you can assign patrol slots you are required to setup
                 the patrol functionality.  The following steps explain how to do this.<br />
